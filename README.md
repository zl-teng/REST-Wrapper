# AxaptaAPI
Dynamics AX 2012 RESTful API

### The Project
AxaptaAPI project was created to expose AX 2012 SOAP AIF web-services as RESTful services, making it easily consumed by any client/platform and easily extended. Works with AIF Document services, System services and Custom services.

### Compatibility
The API was created to be used with AX 2012 (any release). No version for AX7 will be done, since it already works using REST/OData services. A portability to AX 2009 is technically possible but out of the scope of this project.

### Documentation
